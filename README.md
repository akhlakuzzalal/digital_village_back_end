## Project Goal

As a developer we make projects to ease the burden of general people. Our project also has a goal to solve some problems. For example the village people have to do a lot of manual work for accomplishing any task related to the government. We want to connect the government with village people through digitalization of the village. The government will provide services through our platform, and the villagers will enjoy it.
Our main goal is to build an analog village into a digital one.
